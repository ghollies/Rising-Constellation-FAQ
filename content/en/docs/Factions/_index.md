## Myrmezir
![Myrmezir](/images/myrmezir.png)
### History
By breaking with the autocratic tradition, the foundation of Myrmezir made a dent in the long-standing
political fabric of the Tetrarchy and attracted to it many ideological allies. Hardly considered by the
overconfident Tetrarchs, Myrmezir and its new adherents have grown in power to the point that they no
longer care about the opinions of their masters and defied them by abolishing machine slavery.</br></br>
It was in 3670 after the Tetrarchy that Myrmezir decided to elect its primarch democratically rather than
by appointment as was the Tetrarchic custom. In just 300 years, many foundations have followed its
example. The Ariance Charter cemented a pact between thousands of worlds that were determined to
emancipate themselves little by little from the totalitarian monster that is the Tetrarchy.</br></br>
On 1 α-Quartos 3958, exalted by its new status of revolutionary leader, Myrmezir decreed the abolition
of the machine slavery; something all tetrarchs were fiercely opposed to since the dawn of time. This
Myrmezirian decree had an enormous impact on the galaxy. It was a wonderful emancipatory
opportunity for many worlds populated mostly by androids and other sentient machines. It reshuffled
the cards of the diplomatic game and bankrupted a few multisidereals that were not compensated for
the loss of their free labor.</br></br>
Jasselan of Myrmezir is a figure who masters the art of speech like no other in the galaxy. His rhetoric
and fiery style have propelled Myrmeziran ideals into the minds of entire populations. Thanks to him,
Myrmezir is ably defended in the most tense diplomatic negotiations.

## A.R.K
![ARK](/images/ark.png)
### History
A.R.K. is a consortium resulting from the merger of three major groups: Azkos Technologies, Ravecroft and Kovaka.
Involved in the aerospace, entertainment and terraforming industries, respectively, these sprawling companies have
come together to form a superstructure that sits at the same negotiating table as the most powerful states in the
galaxy. The A.R.K. has a motto: "money, pleasure, opportunity".</br></br>
Stelloliberals are for pleasure and comfort at all costs. They love competition in all its forms: in economics, in sports
and more recently in geopolitical conflicts. The Arkian culture favors the strongest and the smartest. Some deserve
to rise, they are the winners. Others deserve to be almost nothing, they are the losers.</br></br>
Able to arm a veritable war fleet, the A.R.K. no longer hides its ambition to exist outside the Tetrarchy in a world
where its billions of employees will act as Arkian citizens. Commercially connected to a huge number of systems,
its aspiration to independence is a major problem for all factions.</br></br>
The A.R.K. is driven by ambitious and unscrupulous leaders, but this is not enough to fight a war and win. If it
wants to become an empire, it will have to structure itself and give itself body. Felicity Blaze, a skilled negotiator, is
the A.R.K.'s representative at the Quadrinople summit.</br></br>
Promoting total market freedom in the galaxy and at the same time presenting the Consortium as a state structure,
such is the great paradox that the A.R.K.'s most formidable ambassador must defend.

## Cardan
![Cardan](/images/cardan.png)
### History
The War of the Worthies has been declared and its outcome will determine who deserves to be saved by
the Others and who must die by their will. Despite the countless disparities between them and the
abandoning of the more ancient traditions, Cardanians are once again united behind a common goal: to
liberate the world from the despotic Tetrarchy, abolitionist vermin, Synelectic insubordination, and
ruthless stello-liberalism.</br></br>
Cardan’s origins go back to the dawn of interstellar travel and the “Primo-Cataclysm”. This dark event in
which Berceau and Asylamba, the original planets of humanity, were ravaged, gave rise to the belief in
“Others”. These supposedly superior beings, also known as “Alkarun”, are feared by the Cardanians who
consider them gods who punish those who value excess over sobriety. The Order of Siderians, guarantor
of the cult’s founding precepts, has given the name “Cardan” to the universal community subject to the
Others.</br></br>
Over the millennia, Cardan has split into a multitude of sub-groups with diverse beliefs, but the faithful
have come together under one banner for the Quadrinople Summit to regain control over a decadent
galaxy.</br></br>
The presence of the mysterious Baharith Taleh at the table of the world’s leaders surprised everyone.
The chilling stories of the Alkamantes of the Taleh Foundation suggest that total war and expansion of
the cult through force are the only demands the Cardanians will make of the rest of the world.

## Synelectic Federation
![Synelectic](/images/synelectic.png)
### History
Scattered, remote or living on hostile planets, the Syns had to form a federation to prevent their
neighbors from plundering them.</br></br>
The Synelectic Federation brings together a multitude of peoples who can sometimes be very different
from each other.</br></br>
The history of the Synelectic Federation begins long before the Tetrarchy and even before the Akhenian
Empire. The first systems to ally themselves were said to have done so in reaction to the Cardanian Wars
of the Worthy around 2400 Before the Tetrarchy. Since then, the federation has grown little by little,
regularly welcoming new members. Some conquests, notably those of Akhena and the Tetrarchy, have
taken away many Syn territories, but there are many stories of heroic resistance and the Syn way of life
has been conducive to the creation of illustrious characters such as Nando Mikali, Kae Horo and Ali the
Syn.</br></br>
Faced with this looming threat that uncomfortably stretches towards their worlds’ borders, the Syns have
taken their responsibilities and are more united than ever. Baikin Shendo, who had already repelled the
Cardanians with very limited means during the invasion of the Nikar Belt, has been named Arkoshak.
In Baikin Shendo, the Synelectic Federation has in its ranks one of the greatest minds in the galaxy. In
many ways, he is the perfect embodiment of Syn values: pragmatism, tolerance and determination. By
relying on the Grey Militia, an army of craftsmen, mechanics and engineers, Synel’s fleets possess
resilience and adaptability the likes of which their rivals envy.

## Tetrarchy
![Tetrarchy](/images/tetrarchy.png)
### History
No one is indifferent to the Tetrarchy because, wherever you are in the galaxy, you are bound to have a
link with this hegemonic empire that has ruled the vast majority of habitable worlds for more than three
millennia.</br></br>
Its history goes back to the immense Akhenian Empire, which was threatening to descend into a bloody
civil war.</br></br>
The Empress Agma had the wisdom to separate the power in four and to found the Tetrarchy. She
established four capitals: Chatur, Quartos, Tetran and Quadrinople. She appointed four tetrarchs who
would rule jointly over the Empty Empire. She instituted the tetrarchic calendar and wrote the new
Constitution. According to her countless admirers, her political work would bring 4000 years of
happiness and prosperity to the Tetrarchy.</br></br>
Helped by the network of heliotors, a new means of transportation that allowed to reach two stars at a
speed never seen before, the Tetrarchs continued their conquests and extended their domain.</br></br>
Now, on the eve of its 4000th anniversary, the Tetrarchy faces a new threat unlike anything it has ever
faced before. Myrmezir has abolished machine slavery and increased his power tenfold by ratifying the
Arian Charter. This turn of events threatens to throw the galaxy into unprecedented chaos. With their
backs to the wall, the Tetrarchs have only one hope to avoid seeing their empire implode: to be worthy
of their glorious Akhenian ancestors. For this, they rely on Arledge Galtacon, the supreme navarch, the
most feared strategist in the galaxy.

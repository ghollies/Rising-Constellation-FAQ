  How does the Market work?
---

### Market
The Market was a feature added 1/24/2022 and introduced a more flexible option for players to trade resources, agents and fleets between players. Players can create a sell offer, and decide who it will be visible to, and other players will be able to choose to buy those offers with credits plus a static tax.

| Item Being sold | Tax |
|---|---|---|
|Technology|  1 to 1 |
|Ideology |  1 to 1 |
|Agents| 5000 * level |
|Agent with Fleet | (5000 * level) + (Fleet maintenance cost * 26.25) | 

### When can I sell an Agent?
You can create an offer for any agent who is not in the middle of an action or moving. For Siderians and Erased, they could be in the process of resting or returning to cover. This includes agents still in your deck, or deployed into the world.

### Once a deployed agent is up for sale, what can I do with it?
It begins to reject all orders when on the market, but is still vulnerable to attack.


### Where will my agent appear?
The agent will appear in your deck if being sold from the deck, or in the location they were put up for sale if they were deployed.

#### How do I know if the agent I am buying is deployed or in the deck?
Erased and Siderian wil show their cover/rest meters if deployed, and a navarch will show their fleet.

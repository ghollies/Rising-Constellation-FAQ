### Mobility
#### What does each point do?
it increases credits by .1 per system population . When received from a building in a system, it increases the mobility in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.
#### Other impacts
Mobility is a scaling factor for two late-game buildings: reflect district and business arch. They are generally considered some of the best late game credit generation buildings.


### Stability 
When received from a building in a system, it increases the stability in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.

Factorâ€™s into growth speed, as you approach 0 stability, or negative values, growth will be hindered.

When below 0, penalties to the system production will occur

### What exactly does SLSD do?
SLSD is like radar? It shows enemy fleet movement in range. Higher SLSD means the radius is larger.


### Resources
#### How fast do resources accumulate?
The number at the bottom of your screen next to each resource show the amount that will be gained every 3 minutes (In Legacy mode). Common practice is to think of at x20 for the amount per hour you will have.

#### Resource Tax on player trades
How long does it take for tax to drop from 60 to 5
not sure anymore..
but like 2% per hour? 

#### Is there a resource cap?
No

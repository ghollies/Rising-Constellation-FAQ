### Mobility ![Mobility](/images/mobility.PNG)
#### What does each point do?
it increases credits by .1 per system population . When received from a building in a system, it increases the mobility in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.
#### Other impacts
Mobility is a scaling factor for two late-game buildings: reflect district and business arch. They are generally considered some of the best late game credit generation buildings.


### Stability ![Stability](/images/stability.PNG)
When received from a building in a system, it increases the stability in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.

Factorâ€™s into growth speed, as you approach 0 stability, or negative values, growth will be hindered.

When below 0, penalties to the system production will occur

### What exactly does SLSD do? ![SLSD](/images/SLSD.PNG)
SLSD is like radar? It shows enemy fleet movement in range. Higher SLSD means the radius is larger.

### What exactly does Intelligence do? ![intelligence](/images/intelligence.PNG)
It makes actions performed by Erased and other agents more difficult

### What exactly does Cybersecurity do? ![cybersecurity](/images/cybersecurity.PNG)
Inspects and removes enemy malware in the system, reducing enemy visibility. See [Infiltration](/docs/agents/erased/#infiltration)


### Resources
#### How fast do resources accumulate?
The number at the bottom of your screen next to each resource show the amount that will be gained every 3 minutes (In Legacy mode). Common practice is to think of at x20 for the amount per hour you will have.
<br/>Example where the player is earning 3441 credits, 205 tech and 363 ideology per 3 minutes <br/>

### Victory
#### How does one team win? 
There are 3 paths to victory. Each path gives 2/3/5 stars depending on the goals reached. The goal of the game is to hit the 12 stars mark first as a team.

### Mobility
#### What does each point do?
it increases credits by .1 per system population . When received from a building in a system, it increases the mobility in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.
#### Other impacts
Mobility is a scaling factor for two late-game buildings: reflect district and business arch. They are generally considered some of the best late game credit generation buildings.


### Stability 
When received from a building in a system, it increases the stability in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.

Factor’s into growth speed, as you approach 0 stability, or negative values, growth will be hindered.

When below 0, penalties to the system production will occur

### What exactly does SLSD do?
SLSD is like radar? It shows enemy fleet movement in range. Higher SLSD means the radius is larger.

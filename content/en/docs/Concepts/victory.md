  Paths to Victory
---
### Victory
#### How does one team win? 
There are 3 paths to victory. Each path gives 2/3/5 stars depending on the goals reached. Stars from previous levels are accumulated and still count towards victory. The goal of the game is to hit the 14 stars mark first as a team.

*Example*: A team could win with 5+3+2 stars from Path of Shadows, and 2 stars from Influence and Conquest. (10 + 2 + 2 = 14)

#### Path of Conquest
Stars are earned by a faction controlling a sector. Each sector is worth a certain number of Sector Points, and there are thresholds for how many sector points are needed for each of the star levels. You can hover over a sector to see the number of points it is worth (in the middle diamond).

Example progression from a legacy game with 2 factions: 
| Stars | Sector Points|
| --- | --- |
|2|9|
|3|21|
|5|32|
These numbers will be different depending on the map layout and number of factions involved.

#### Path of Influence
Stars are earned by have large populations in star systems. Each system is worth a certain number of Star System Points which is dependant on the population of the system.
##### Star System Points per population
| Population | Star System Points|
| --- | --- |
|>0|1|
|>40|2|
|>60|4|
|>70|7|
|>80|11|
|>90|16|
|>120|25|
|>180|75|

Example from a Legacy game with 2 factions, and 49 players on one of the factions:
| Stars | Sector Points|
| --- | --- |
|2|1021|
|3|2042|
|5|4083|
These numbers will depend on the number of players in the faction.

#### Path of Shadows
Stars are earned by Visibility Points which are the first 5 points of visibility on enemy systems. This can be done by an Erased agent using the [Infiltration](/docs/agents/erased/#infiltration) action. There are thresholds for how many Visibility Points are needed for each of the star levels, and scales by the number of enemy systems.
Unlike the other two paths, this value is hidden from the enemy.

Example from a Legacy game with 2 factions mid way into the game:
| Stars | Visibility Points|
| --- | --- |
|2|415|
|3|669|
|5|752|

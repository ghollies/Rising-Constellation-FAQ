### What ships counter what?
There is still a lot of room to develop new fleet strategies and counters, but some basics about which ships counter other ships can be derived from looking at their stats, and how the fighting mechanics work out:

With their high ship count and moderate overall damage, they are a good counter to Gunners, who can only fire once per attack.
</br></br>


{{< svg "ships/gunner.svg" >}} **Gunners**:
With their high explosive damage they do well against high shield targets with low Flack, such as Drone Carriers and Assault Frigates
</br></br>

With their high HP and multiple shots, they are good at taking out fighters of all types.
</br></br>


Corvettes lay somewhere in the middle, 2x or 4x corvettes will have a hard time against any frigate class, but the more combat focused types (Light Corvettes and multi turret) will do well when they hit the 8x level, at least until the frigates hit their 4x. They can however be an early counter to fighter fleets.

When looking to counter a specific enemy fleet, consider setting up a [simulated fight](https://rising-constellation.com/portal/fight-simulator) and playing around with your fleet design in terms of order/layout and composition

### Legacy

There are many possible strategies, especially when coordinating with other members in your faction.

The two below are both valid options, though may be less accurate now with recent changes in game.

#### Opening (From Legacy 5)
Credit: Lopy with changes/adjustments by Pray:

BUILDINGS TO START:

habitable planet 1 -> delta polytech -> citadel -> 4 residences<br/>
habitable planet 2 -> megapolis -> citadel -> delta polytech<br/>
CHILL/WAIT<br/>
hp 1 -> upgrade citadel to 2, polytech to 2<br/>
hp -> upgrade citadel to 2, polytech to 2<br/>
CHILL/WAIT<br/>
hp 1 -> floating gardens <br/>
hp 2 -> floating gardens <br/>
hp 1 -> upgrade floating gardens to 2<br/>
hp 2 -> upgrade floating gardens to 2<br/>
CHILL/WAIT<br/>
barren planet -> possible impact research center + 4 arrays of excavators before archipelagos ( dont surpass your population )<br/>
hp 2 -> residential archipelago<br/>
hp 1 -> delete 1 residence -> residential archipelago; do it for all residences 1 by 1<br/>
(CHILL/WAIT if you need more population)<br/>
5g ast 1 -> 1 refining ducts<br/>
5g ast 2 -> 1 RD<br/>
4t ast 1 -> 1 experiment station<br/>
4t ast 2 -> 1 ES<br/>
4t ast 3 -> 1 ES<br/>
4t ast 4 -> 1 ES<br/>
3t ast 1 -> 1 ES<br/>
ONLY UPGRADE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. colony ship eats 80k credits, so calc it out with your hypersleep chamber so you can queue it as soon as you get the tech<br/>
4t ast 1 -> upgrade ES<br/>
4t ast 2 -> upgrade ES<br/>
4t ast 3 -> upgrade ES<br/>
4t ast 4 -> upgrade ES<br/>
5g ast 1 -> upgrade RD<br/>
5g ast 2 -> upgrade RD<br/>
3t ast 1 -> upgrade ES<br/>
build colony ship ( 32000 production, 80000 credits, 3000 tech ) [ 10 hours ]<br/>
<br/>
TECHS TO START:
<br/>
Holographic Storage System -> Urbanization -> Urbanization II -> maglev architecture -> publicity terminals -> magnetic pipelines -> exobiology -> pressurized enviroment II -> hypersleep chamber -> floating cities
<br/>
<br/>
Another way ( works best if you get tech from someone ):<br/>
Holographic Storage System -> Urbanization -> Urbanization II -> publicity terminals -> floating cities -> magnetic pipelines -> exobiology -> floating cities -> pressurized enviroment II -> hypersleep chamber<br/>
<br/>
LEX TO START: 
<br/>
First Contacts -> Linguistic Unification -> Mass Media -> Promotion of Science -> Sponsored Chairmanship -> Proto-Empire -> Extended Administration -> Stelloliberal maze<br/><br/>
Or the adjusted tech rush build by pray:<br/>
Skip garden and everything, after poly tech to 2, rush experiment station 1 and lvl 2 on asteroid.<br/>


#### Opening (From Legacy 3)

In most circumstances, you want to colonize 3 systems as soon as possible. 

In the beginning, build *Delta Polytech*{{< svg "buildings/university.svg" >}} on your first planet, buy tech for *Citadel* {{< svg "buildings/ideo.svg" >}} and build the *Citadel* on the planet as well.

Buy the first technology in habitable, sterile, and asteroid. Build *Megapolis*{{< svg "buildings/main_building.svg" >}} on the other habitable and *Central Hub* {{< svg "buildings/main_building.svg" >}}on the sterile.

Build both *Delta Polytech* and *Citadel* on the second habitable, and build 3 *Residential Districts* {{< svg "buildings/house.svg" >}} on the first habitable for faster population growth.

Build *Impact Research Center* {{< svg "buildings/microscope.svg" >}} on the sterile planet, and build one *Refining Duct* {{< svg "buildings/factory.svg" >}}  on each of the 5 industry potential asteroid.

Wait for *Exobiology* patent, and build *Experiment stations* {{< svg "buildings/microscope.svg" >}} on every asteroid except the 1 potential one. Buy patent for asteroid level 2, and upgrade asteroid buildings.

Wait for colony ship technology. Buy navarch and colony ship. Look for systems with many habitable slots and good appeal potential because the second system should focus on credit.

Research *Publicity Terminal* patent and replace the houses on home planet with *Archipelagoes* {{< svg "buildings/double_house.svg" >}} . Research habitable level 2. When colonization is complete, develop the second colony and recall the navarch.

Deploy the navarch in home system once the cooldown finishes, and build the next colony ship. You should get enough ideology for the third system when the second colony ship is completed and moves to its destination.

For Lex, rush *Mass Media* and ignore everything else. Buy Lex slots to make sure all lexes are applied. After *Mass Media* buy *Propaganda* to keep population growing. After that save up for *Proto Empire* and after that *Extended Administration*.

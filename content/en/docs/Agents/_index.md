[Erased](https://asylamba.com/public/media/files/sources/erased-cardan.png)

Each agent has a preferred skill and a second preferred. It has 47% chance to get a point in his first skill, 29% in the second skill and 6% in each other skills.

5% multiplier for each rank

Usually, yes. All of the Siderian skills and all of the Erased skills (other than infiltration), require a skill point to be able to perform the action. Navarch agents dont need the skill point if the fleet their commanding has the appropriate attributes (bombing or invasion power)

### Does an agent's "favorite faction" affect anything?
not yet.. we want to use it to make easier seduction in certain case, but not implemented yet

instantaneous actions are : fights / sabotage / assassination / seduction

Yes, shared among all players in the game.

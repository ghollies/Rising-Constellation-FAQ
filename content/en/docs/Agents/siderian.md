  Agents which can use Propaganda, Destabilize, or Seduce
---

## Abilities
### Propaganda
This ability is used to take control over an AI controlled system. It takes the agent's propaganda skill and compares it to the current stability of the system. The attempt takes a long amount of time (~8 hours in legacy). Requires the agent to rest afterwards before they can use any other abilities.

### Destabilize
This ability reduces the stability of the current system. Useful for setting up a propaganda action later, or reducing the efficiency of the current system. Takes a moderate amount of time (~2.5 hours in legacy). Requires the agent to rest afterwards before they can use any other abilities.

### Seduce
This ability can only be used when in the same system as an enemy agent who is visible. If successful, will convert the agent to your side! Instantaneous. TODO/verify: Requires the agent to rest afterwards before they can use any other abilities.

## Abilities
### Pillaging ![Bombing](/images/bombing.PNG)
Allows a navarch to raid resources from an enemy controlled system or dominion. Compares the navarch's total bombing power against the defense of the system. Increased by Conquest skill, and by having certain types of ships in the fleet. see [Ship Stats - Bombing](/docs/ships/stats/#what-are-the-base-stats-of-all-of-the-ships) 
#### Does the time to pillage depend on bombing power?
yes slightly depends on defense and bombing power. The base time length for a pillage is 1h
### How much will I get from pillaging?
One pillage gives 150 ticks of the production of the system for a normal level of success, and 200 ticks for a critical. Each pillage lowers % of resources raided by 45% and it recovers over time by .25% per tick 

### Conquest ![Invasion](/images/invasion.PNG)

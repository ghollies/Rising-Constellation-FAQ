  Fleets and ships
---

### How does experience enhance fleets? How much experience per level?
+0.5% of main stats per lvl
(att, def etc..)
and more moral, so less likely to flee when other squads are killed. XP is not flat by lvl but exponential, like agent xp

### Is there a place I can find out what the ship stats do? like what is maneuverability, and the difference between energy and explosive attack, etc?
[Battle simulator](https://rising-constellation.com/portal/fight-simulator) in the game under the Koshak Academy the best source of information 
energy attack is reduced by [shield](/docs/ships/stats/#shield), and explosive can be blocked by [flack](/docs/ships/stats/#flack)

### Can we donate ships?
No, only resources

### How do I build a fleet
To build a fleet, you must first build the necessary buildings on a moon or asteroid of a system you control (not a dominion), and then deploy a navarch on that system. By selecting it, a small interface appears, displaying six lines of three boxes. You can then design your fleet by clicking on the empty boxes and building the desired ships.

### What kind of ships should I build?
Strategies are still developing, take a look at [Fleet Composition](/docs/strategies/fleets/) and [Ship Stats](/docs/ships/stats/) to help figure out what to include in your fleet. Consider not only fleet to fleet combat, but also do you need bombing power to pillage/bombard? or invasion power for conquest?

### Types of ships
There are 5 types of ships in Rising Constellation.

#### The Transports
the carriers are individual ships with little to no ship to ship combat ability, however they are useful for taking control of systems by conquest or colonization
* {{< svg "ships/colony_ship.svg" >}} **Colony Ship**
This is one of the first ships you will be buildings in order to expand your empire. It has no combat ability so protect it if you think enemies may be around. It can be used to colonize unpopulated systems. 
* {{< svg "ships/carrier.svg" >}} **Carrier**
Very little combat power but can bring a lot of invasion power to a fleet, allowing it to attempt [Conquest](/docs/agents/navarch/#conquest-invasionimagesinvasionpng)

#### The Fighters
The fighters can be in squadrons of 2 to 16 fighters of the same type. They are the smallest combat ships, have the lowest maintenance costs and are the most numerous per squadron. To build fighters, it is necessary to have built an S-01 assembly line on a moon or an asteroid.

* {{< svg "ships/scout.svg" >}} **Scouts** 
The first type of ship available to players, these are cheap and can help fill in your fleets
* {{< svg "ships/fighter_bomber.svg" >}} **Fighter-bomber**
The first type of ship available to players with a bombing rating, providing bonuses to [Pillaging]({{< ref "/docs/agents/navarch.md#pillaging" >}}), or allowing an unskilled navarch to perform the action
* {{< svg "ships/light_fighter.svg" >}} **Light fighter**
* {{< svg "ships/interceptor.svg" >}} **Interceptors**

#### Corvettes
The corvettes can be in squadrons of 2 to 8 corvettes of the same type. Inexpensive but effective combat ships with an average maintenance cost. To build corvettes, it is necessary to have built an S-02 assembly line on a moon or an asteroid.

* {{< svg "ships/light_corvette.svg" >}} **Light corvettes**
* {{< svg "ships/heavy_corvette.svg" >}} **Heavy corvettes**
* {{< svg "ships/multi_turret_corvette.svg" >}} **Multi-turret corvettes**

#### The Frigates
Frigates can be in units of 2 to 4 frigates of the same type. The modular fuselage of the frigates allows the specialization of the vessels to fulfill their mission. To build a frigate, it is necessary to have built a space shipyard on a moon or an asteroid.

* {{< svg "ships/assault_frigate.svg" >}} **Assault frigates**
* {{< svg "ships/gunner.svg" >}} **Gunners**
* {{< svg "ships/drone_carrier.svg" >}} **Drone Carriers**
* {{< svg "ships/repair_platform.svg" >}} **Repair platforms**
* {{< svg "ships/carrier.svg" >}} **Carriers**

#### Capital ships
Capital ships are always alone in their squadron. They are very expensive to maintain. To build a capital ship, it is necessary to have built an assembly hyperstructure on a moon or an asteroid. Capital ships have unique names such as: "The Merciless", "The Conqueror", "The Redoubtable", etc ...

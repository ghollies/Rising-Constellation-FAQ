  How to contribute to the docs
---

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website and the
[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure.
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, 
content organization in a standard directory structure, and a website generation 
engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

## Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.

## Creating an issue
You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the **Create Issue** button in the top right hand corner of the page.

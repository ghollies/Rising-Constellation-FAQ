They are the smallest combat ships, have the lowest maintenance costs and are the most numerous per squadron. To build fighters, it is necessary to have built an S-01 assembly line on a moon or an asteroid.\n Scouts The first type of ship avalible to players, these are cheap and can help fill in your fleets Fighter-bomber The first type of ship availible to players with a bombing rating, providing bonuses to Pillaging, or allowing an unskilled navarch to perform the action Light fighter Interceptors  Corvettes The corvettes can be in squadrons of 2 to 8 corvettes of the same type.

To build corvettes, it is necessary to have built an S-02 assembly line on a moon or an asteroid.\n Light corvettes Heavy corvettes Multi-turret corvettes  The Frigates Frigates can be in units of 2 to 4 frigates of the same type. The modular fuselage of the frigates allows the specialization of the vessels to fulfill their mission. To build a frigate, it is necessary to have built a space shipyard on a moon or an asteroid.\n Assault frigates Gunners Drone Carrers Repair platforms Carriers  Capital ships Capital ships are always alone in their squadron.

Buy patent for asteroid level 2, and upgrade asteroid buildings.\nWait for colony ship technology. Buy navarch and colony ship. Look for systems with many habitable slots and good appeal potential because the second system should focus on credit.\nResearch Publicity Terminal patent and replace the houses on home planet with Archipelagoes. Research habitable level 2. When colonization is complete, develop the second colony and recall the navarch.\nDeploy the navarch in home system once the cooldown finishes, and build the next colony ship. You should get enough ideology for the third system when the second colony ship is completed and moves to its destination.\nFor Lex, rush Mass Media and ignore everything else.

Both of these will require an open slot (either as dominion, or system slot)\nWhere should I take a Dominion? Anywhere where your faction could use an additional system controlled, or a system which you think would be valuable from a resource generation or population perspective. Releasing systems into Dominions is a good way to ensure they have good income and population, freeing up a system slot for a potentially more forward location.\nCan I use a colony ship to take control of an autonomous system? No, only conquest or propaganda\nWhat sectors can I take over an AI controlled system in? You can only take control of systems in sectors adjacent to one your faction already owns, or in a sector your faction owns.\nAutonomous systems Are they farmable? yes, Pillaging them is a good way to both level up your agents, and gain resources, repairing buildings is not too hard if someone takes it over. see Pillaging\nDominions What do I get for having a dominion? You get a base 30% of the resources (credit/technology/ideology) generated by the system, it counts towards ownership of sector for your faction, and its population counts towards the Path of Influence victory. You can view your current dominion tax rate in the overview panel (bottom left corner button), it can be increased with Lexes\nIf I queue a bunch of upgrades in a system and then flip it to domain, does it continue on its happy path? yes\nIf I develop a system then switch it over to a domain system, does the AI then re-build everything or would it stay optimized to what I have created? IA can’t destroy then rebuild, so it will stay optimized. However, it won’t upgrade them all the way (stops when all the slots are taken by a building)\nSwapping a system from dominion to system has an increasing ideology cost of +5k each time you flip any system. It is sometimes better to abandon the system and then take control with a siderian, takes more time but has no increasing cost.\n","categories":["Examples"],"description":"Dominions and Autonomous Systems\n","excerpt":"Dominions and Autonomous Systems\n","ref":"/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/systems/dominions/","tags":["test","sample","docs"],"title":"Dominions and Autonomous Systems"},{"body":"Monolith - Does it scale based on planet or system population?

<p>Each system has a 20k gauge of cybersecurity. Each tick the cybersecurity score of a system fills in the gauge. When it reaches 20k it removes a random malware, from one faction only, reducing enemy visibility.</br>
<em>Example</em>: In a Legacy game a system with 50 cybersecurity, will gain 1000 points/hours, so it will remove 1 malware, over 20 hours.</br>

    <div class="lead">Paths to Victory</div>
	<h3 id="victory">Victory</h3>
<h4 id="how-does-one-team-win">How does one team win?</h4>
<p>There are 3 paths to victory. Each path gives 2/3/5 stars depending on the goals reached. Stars from previous levels are accumulated and still count towards victory. The goal of the game is to hit the 14 stars mark first as a team.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A team could win with 5+3+2 stars from Path of Shadows, and 2 stars from Influence and Conquest. (10 + 2 + 2 = 14)</p>
<h4 id="path-of-conquest">Path of Conquest</h4>
<p>Stars are earned by a faction controlling a sector. Each sector is worth a certain number of Sector Points, and there are thresholds for how many sector points are needed for each of the star levels. You can hover over a sector to see the number of points it is worth (in the middle diamond).</p>

<h4 id="path-of-influence">Path of Influence</h4>
<p>Stars are earned by have large populations in star systems. Each system is worth a certain number of Star System Points which is dependant on the population of the system.</p>

<h4 id="path-of-shadows">Path of Shadows</h4>
<p>Stars are earned by Visibility Points which are the first 5 points of visibility on enemy systems. This can be done by an Erased agent using the <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/erased/#infiltration">Infiltration</a> action. There are thresholds for how many Visibility Points are needed for each of the star levels, and scales by the number of enemy systems.
Unlike the other two paths, this value is hidden from the enemy.</p>

    <div class="lead">How does combat between two fleets get resolved?</div>
	<h3 id="how-is-combat-initiated">How is combat initiated?</h3>
<p>When two <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/">Navarch</a> agents are in the same system combat can begin in one of three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A player clicks on the the enemy Navarch while selecting their, and chooses to fight.</li>
<li>A Navarch set to <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/#stance">Aggressive or Fury stance</a> will immediately attack enemy fleets in their system. If more than one fleet in a system is set to aggressive <strong>only one will fight</strong> and the others will just spectate 
</br><strong>NOTE</strong>: There is currently a bug preventing this from happening if the fleet is entering the system, it will only trigger when another fleet enters the system.</li>
<li>A Navarch set to <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/#defender">Defender stance</a> will begin a fight if the system they are in is under attack (Pillage/Bombard/Colonization). Defender stance will also allow the navarch to join another navarch of the same faction in combat against the enemy.</li>

<h3 id="how-does-combat-get-resolved">How does Combat get resolved?</h3>
<p>Combat occurs in rounds during each round the following phases take place:</p>
<h4 id="1-deployment">1. Deployment</h4>
<p>The squadron in the row corresponding to the round number are added to the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: On the first round of combat, the squadron in the L1 column would be deployed, (Drone Carriers in this case)</p>
<p><img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/fleet_example_1.PNG" alt="Fleet Example 1"></p>
<h5 id="multiple-defending-navarch">Multiple Defending Navarch</h5>
<p>If there are more than one defending navarchs in the system, the supporting ones will join in later rounds 3, 6 and 9&hellip;.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: 3 navarch are defending a system (A,B,C), and an attacker comes in (X). Per round joining the fight:</p>
<ol>
<li>A-L1 and X-L1</li>
<li>A-L2 and X-L2</li>
<li>A-L3 + B-L1 and X-L3</li>
<li>A-L4 + B-L2 and X-L4</li>
<li>A-L5 + B-L3 and X-L5</li>
<li>A-L6 + B-L4 and X-L6</li>
<li>B-L5</li>
<li>B-L6</li>
<li>C-L1</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="2-roll-for-initiative">2. Roll for initiative</h4>
<p>The navarchs commanding the fleets roll off, using their  navarch levels as a modifier so that the higher level one will win more often.</p>
<h4 id="3-attack">3. Attack</h4>
<p>Each squadron takes turns making all of its attacks against a random enemy squadron on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: a squadron of 2 Gunner ships would make 2 explosive attacks, where a squadron of 8 Light Fighters would make 8 * (2 energy attacks + 1 explosive attack) for a total of 24 individual attacks.</p>
<p>All of the damage from an attack goes to an individual ship, so even if a Gunner attacks and hits a light fighter with 25 health, most of the 390 of its attack is wasted, as it only removes a single ship from the squadron of light fighters. <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/">Ship Stats</a></p>
<h3 id="morale">Morale</h3>
<p>Each ship has a morale base, increased by the level of the ship.
Ships start at 20 morale, and every level after gets you 0.5% more that also applies to all of the other statistics of the ship
During a fight, if a squadron&rsquo;s morale hits 0, they will flee the combat. 
Morale resets at the end of each combat, so squadron are always back at full morale value before the next fight.</p>
<h4 id="what-causes-morale-loss">What causes morale loss?</h4>
<p>Morale is lowered with this events:</p>
<ul>
<li>on squadron: when 1 ship of the squadron is destroyed</li>
<li>on entire fleet: when 1 squadron of the fleet is destroyed</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-causes-squadrons-to-no-longer-respond-to-orders-and-flee-in-combat">What causes squadrons to no longer respond to orders and flee in combat?</h4>
<p>Running out of morale</p>

	<h2 id="myrmezir">Myrmezir</h2>
<p><img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/myrmezir.png" alt="Myrmezir"></p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>By breaking with the autocratic tradition, the foundation of Myrmezir made a dent in the long-standing
political fabric of the Tetrarchy and attracted to it many ideological allies. Hardly considered by the
overconfident Tetrarchs, Myrmezir and its new adherents have grown in power to the point that they no
longer care about the opinions of their masters and defied them by abolishing machine slavery.</br></br>
It was in 3670 after the Tetrarchy that Myrmezir decided to elect its primarch democratically rather than
by appointment as was the Tetrarchic custom. In just 300 years, many foundations have followed its
example. The Ariance Charter cemented a pact between thousands of worlds that were determined to
emancipate themselves little by little from the totalitarian monster that is the Tetrarchy.</br></br>
On 1 α-Quartos 3958, exalted by its new status of revolutionary leader, Myrmezir decreed the abolition
of the machine slavery; something all tetrarchs were fiercely opposed to since the dawn of time. This
Myrmezirian decree had an enormous impact on the galaxy. It was a wonderful emancipatory
opportunity for many worlds populated mostly by androids and other sentient machines. It reshuffled
the cards of the diplomatic game and bankrupted a few multisidereals that were not compensated for
the loss of their free labor.</br></br>
Jasselan of Myrmezir is a figure who masters the art of speech like no other in the galaxy. His rhetoric
and fiery style have propelled Myrmeziran ideals into the minds of entire populations. Thanks to him,
Myrmezir is ably defended in the most tense diplomatic negotiations.</p>
<h2 id="ark">A.R.K</h2>
<p><img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/ark.png" alt="ARK"></p>
<h3 id="history-1">History</h3>
<p>A.R.K. is a consortium resulting from the merger of three major groups: Azkos Technologies, Ravecroft and Kovaka.
Involved in the aerospace, entertainment and terraforming industries, respectively, these sprawling companies have
come together to form a superstructure that sits at the same negotiating table as the most powerful states in the
galaxy. The A.R.K. has a motto: &ldquo;money, pleasure, opportunity&rdquo;.</br></br>
Stelloliberals are for pleasure and comfort at all costs. They love competition in all its forms: in economics, in sports
and more recently in geopolitical conflicts. The Arkian culture favors the strongest and the smartest. Some deserve
to rise, they are the winners. Others deserve to be almost nothing, they are the losers.</br></br>
Able to arm a veritable war fleet, the A.R.K. no longer hides its ambition to exist outside the Tetrarchy in a world
where its billions of employees will act as Arkian citizens. Commercially connected to a huge number of systems,
its aspiration to independence is a major problem for all factions.</br></br>
The A.R.K. is driven by ambitious and unscrupulous leaders, but this is not enough to fight a war and win. If it
wants to become an empire, it will have to structure itself and give itself body. Felicity Blaze, a skilled negotiator, is
the A.R.K.&rsquo;s representative at the Quadrinople summit.</br></br>
Promoting total market freedom in the galaxy and at the same time presenting the Consortium as a state structure,
such is the great paradox that the A.R.K.&rsquo;s most formidable ambassador must defend.</p>
<h2 id="cardan">Cardan</h2>
<p><img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/cardan.png" alt="Cardan"></p>
<h3 id="history-2">History</h3>
<p>The War of the Worthies has been declared and its outcome will determine who deserves to be saved by
the Others and who must die by their will. Despite the countless disparities between them and the
abandoning of the more ancient traditions, Cardanians are once again united behind a common goal: to
liberate the world from the despotic Tetrarchy, abolitionist vermin, Synelectic insubordination, and
ruthless stello-liberalism.</br></br>
Cardan’s origins go back to the dawn of interstellar travel and the “Primo-Cataclysm”. This dark event in
which Berceau and Asylamba, the original planets of humanity, were ravaged, gave rise to the belief in
“Others”. These supposedly superior beings, also known as “Alkarun”, are feared by the Cardanians who
consider them gods who punish those who value excess over sobriety. The Order of Siderians, guarantor
of the cult’s founding precepts, has given the name “Cardan” to the universal community subject to the
Others.</br></br>
Over the millennia, Cardan has split into a multitude of sub-groups with diverse beliefs, but the faithful
have come together under one banner for the Quadrinople Summit to regain control over a decadent
galaxy.</br></br>
The presence of the mysterious Baharith Taleh at the table of the world’s leaders surprised everyone.
The chilling stories of the Alkamantes of the Taleh Foundation suggest that total war and expansion of
the cult through force are the only demands the Cardanians will make of the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="synelectic-federation">Synelectic Federation</h2>
<p><img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/synelectic.png" alt="Synelectic"></p>
<h3 id="history-3">History</h3>
<p>Scattered, remote or living on hostile planets, the Syns had to form a federation to prevent their
neighbors from plundering them.</br></br>
The Synelectic Federation brings together a multitude of peoples who can sometimes be very different
from each other.</br></br>
The history of the Synelectic Federation begins long before the Tetrarchy and even before the Akhenian
Empire. The first systems to ally themselves were said to have done so in reaction to the Cardanian Wars
of the Worthy around 2400 Before the Tetrarchy. Since then, the federation has grown little by little,
regularly welcoming new members. Some conquests, notably those of Akhena and the Tetrarchy, have
taken away many Syn territories, but there are many stories of heroic resistance and the Syn way of life
has been conducive to the creation of illustrious characters such as Nando Mikali, Kae Horo and Ali the
Syn.</br></br>
Faced with this looming threat that uncomfortably stretches towards their worlds’ borders, the Syns have
taken their responsibilities and are more united than ever. Baikin Shendo, who had already repelled the
Cardanians with very limited means during the invasion of the Nikar Belt, has been named Arkoshak.
In Baikin Shendo, the Synelectic Federation has in its ranks one of the greatest minds in the galaxy. In
many ways, he is the perfect embodiment of Syn values: pragmatism, tolerance and determination. By
relying on the Grey Militia, an army of craftsmen, mechanics and engineers, Synel’s fleets possess
resilience and adaptability the likes of which their rivals envy.</p>
<h2 id="tetrarchy">Tetrarchy</h2>
<p><img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/tetrarchy.png" alt="Tetrarchy"></p>
<h3 id="history-4">History</h3>
<p>No one is indifferent to the Tetrarchy because, wherever you are in the galaxy, you are bound to have a
link with this hegemonic empire that has ruled the vast majority of habitable worlds for more than three
millennia.</br></br>
Its history goes back to the immense Akhenian Empire, which was threatening to descend into a bloody
civil war.</br></br>
The Empress Agma had the wisdom to separate the power in four and to found the Tetrarchy. She
established four capitals: Chatur, Quartos, Tetran and Quadrinople. She appointed four tetrarchs who
would rule jointly over the Empty Empire. She instituted the tetrarchic calendar and wrote the new
Constitution. According to her countless admirers, her political work would bring 4000 years of
happiness and prosperity to the Tetrarchy.</br></br>
Helped by the network of heliotors, a new means of transportation that allowed to reach two stars at a
speed never seen before, the Tetrarchs continued their conquests and extended their domain.</br></br>
Now, on the eve of its 4000th anniversary, the Tetrarchy faces a new threat unlike anything it has ever
faced before. Myrmezir has abolished machine slavery and increased his power tenfold by ratifying the
Arian Charter. This turn of events threatens to throw the galaxy into unprecedented chaos. With their
backs to the wall, the Tetrarchs have only one hope to avoid seeing their empire implode: to be worthy
of their glorious Akhenian ancestors. For this, they rely on Arledge Galtacon, the supreme navarch, the
most feared strategist in the galaxy.</p>

	<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<h3 id="do-ai-controlled-systems-build-their-own-buildings">Do AI controlled systems build their own buildings?</h3>
<p>They automatically construct buildings over time, very inefficiently. They stop building and upgrading when all of their build slots are full.</p>
<h3 id="will-they-repair-destroyed-buildings">Will they repair destroyed buildings?</h3>
<p>They will prioritize repairing buildings before building new ones and will continue to repair even if all of their building slots are full</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-gain-control-of-a-dominion-or-autonomous-system">How do I gain control of a Dominion or Autonomous System?</h3>
<p>People can flip them to their faction by 2 means:
use Siderians to destabilize and then propaganda them to flip them into dominions
<em>OR</em>
Use a navarch with a fleet to conquer it as a system.
Both of these will require an open slot (either as dominion, or system slot)</p>
<h3 id="where-should-i-take-a-dominion">Where should I take a Dominion?</h3>
<p>Anywhere where your faction could use an additional system controlled, or a system which you think would be valuable from a resource generation or population perspective. Releasing systems into Dominions is a good way to ensure they have good income and population, freeing up a system slot for a potentially more forward location.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-a-colony-ship-to-take-control-of-an-autonomous-system">Can I use a colony ship to take control of an autonomous system?</h3>
<p>No, only conquest or propaganda</p>
<h3 id="what-sectors-can-i-take-over-an-ai-controlled-system-in">What sectors can I take over an AI controlled system in?</h3>
<p>You can only take control of systems in sectors adjacent to one your faction already owns, or in a sector your faction owns.</p>
<h3 id="autonomous-systems">Autonomous systems</h3>
<h4 id="are-they-farmable">Are they farmable?</h4>
<p>yes, Pillaging them is a good way to both level up your agents, and gain resources, repairing buildings is not too hard if someone takes it over. see <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/#pillaging">Pillaging</a></p>
<h3 id="dominions">Dominions</h3>
<h4 id="what-do-i-get-for-having-a-dominion">What do I get for having a dominion?</h4>
<p>You get a base 30% of the resources (credit/technology/ideology) generated by the system, it counts towards ownership of sector for your faction, and its population counts towards the Path of Influence victory. You can view your current dominion tax rate in the overview panel (bottom left corner button), it can be increased with Lexes</p>
<h4 id="if-i-queue-a-bunch-of-upgrades-in-a-system-and-then-flip-it-to-domain-does-it-continue-on-its-happy-path">If I queue a bunch of upgrades in a system and then flip it to domain, does it continue on its happy path?</h4>
<p>yes</p>

<p>IA can&rsquo;t destroy then rebuild, so it will stay optimized. However, it won&rsquo;t upgrade them all the way (stops when all the slots are taken by a building)</p>
<p>Swapping a system from dominion to system has an increasing ideology cost of +5k each time you flip any system. It is sometimes better to abandon the system and then take control with a siderian, takes more time but has no increasing cost.</p>

energy attack is reduced by <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/#shield">shield</a>, and explosive can be blocked by <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/#flack">flack</a></p>
<h3 id="can-we-donate-ships">Can we donate ships?</h3>
<p>You can exchange fleets and navarches on the <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/concepts/market/">Market</a></p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-build-a-fleet">How do I build a fleet</h3>
<p>To build a fleet, you must first build the necessary buildings on a moon or asteroid of a system you control (not a dominion), and then deploy a navarch on that system. By selecting it, a small interface appears, displaying six lines of three boxes. You can then design your fleet by clicking on the empty boxes and building the desired ships.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-ships-should-i-build">What kind of ships should I build?</h3>
<p>Strategies are still developing, take a look at <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/strategies/fleets/">Fleet Composition</a> and <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/">Ship Stats</a> to help figure out what to include in your fleet. Consider not only fleet to fleet combat, but also do you need bombing power to pillage/bombard? or invasion power for conquest?</p>
<h3 id="types-of-ships">Types of ships</h3>
<p>Ships can be broken down into 5 different categories in Rising Constellation.</p>
<h4 id="the-transports">The Transports</h4>
<p>the carriers are individual ships with little to no ship to ship combat ability, however they are useful for taking control of systems by conquest or colonization</p>
<ul>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/colony_ship.svg"/>
 <strong>Colony Ship</strong>
This is one of the first ships you will be buildings in order to expand your empire. It has no combat ability so protect it if you think enemies may be around. It can be used to colonize unpopulated systems.</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/carrier.svg"/>
 <strong>Carrier</strong>
Very little combat power but can bring a lot of invasion power to a fleet, allowing a <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/">Navarch to perform conquest</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-fighters">The Fighters</h4>
<p>The fighters can be in squadrons of 2 to 16 fighters of the same type. They are the smallest combat ships, have the lowest maintenance costs and are the most numerous per squadron. To build fighters, it is necessary to have built an S-01 assembly line on a moon or an asteroid.</p>
<ul>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/scout.svg"/>
 <strong>Scouts</strong> 
The first type of ship available to players, these are cheap and can help fill in your fleets with their low cost, and high maneuverability</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/fighter_bomber.svg"/>
 <strong>Fighter-bomber</strong>
The first type of ship available to players with a bombing rating, providing bonuses to <a href="%22/docs/agents/navarch.md#pillaging%22">Pillaging</a>, or allowing an unskilled navarch to perform the action</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/light_fighter.svg"/>
 <strong>Light fighter</strong>
An early well rounded fighting ship</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/interceptor.svg"/>
 <strong>Interceptors</strong>
Very similar to the light fighter, but with more maneuverability and a focus on energy damage only.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="corvettes">Corvettes</h4>
<p>The corvettes can be in squadrons of 2 to 8 corvettes of the same type. Inexpensive but effective combat ships with an average maintenance cost. To build corvettes, it is necessary to have built an S-02 assembly line on a moon or an asteroid.</p>
<ul>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/light_corvette.svg"/>
 <strong>Light corvettes</strong>
Well balanced fighting ship with modest bombing abilities</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/heavy_corvette.svg"/>
 <strong>Heavy corvettes</strong>
50% more bombing power than light corvettes, and a little harder to kill, but at the cost of ship to ship damage.</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/multi_turret_corvette.svg"/>
 <strong>Multi-turret corvettes</strong>
Twice the cost to maintain as other corvettes, with much more health, and much more ship to ship damage, but no bombing abilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-frigates">The Frigates</h4>
<p>Frigates can be in units of 2 to 4 frigates of the same type. The modular fuselage of the frigates allows the specialization of the vessels to fulfill their mission. To build a frigate, it is necessary to have built a space shipyard on a moon or an asteroid.</p>
<ul>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/assault_frigate.svg"/>
 <strong>Assault frigates</strong>
The first ships that will allow a <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/">Navarch to perform conquest</a> of a system, though it may take several to build up enough invasion power to overcome systems with reasonable defense ratings. These will do reasonably well in a fight, high shield ratings make up for their lower maneuverability and combination of both explosive and energy attacks make reasonable at fighting all types of ships</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/gunner.svg"/>
 <strong>Gunners</strong>
Specialized in killing larger ships, these have few attacks but hit very hard with explosive damage and provide a lot of bombing power.</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/drone_carrier.svg"/>
 <strong>Drone Carriers</strong>
High health and high defense ships with lower damage for the frigate class, but can help add some <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch#repair">repair</a>. your fleet between fights, high cost</li>
<li><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/repair_platform.svg"/>
 <strong>Repair platforms</strong>
A almost fully defensive ship, focused on health and shields and flak, does almost no damage, but brings a lot of <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch#repair">repair</a> power to a fleet.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="capital-ships">Capital ships</h4>
<p>Capital ships are always alone in their squadron. They are very expensive to maintain. To build a capital ship, it is necessary to have built an assembly hyperstructure on a moon or an asteroid. Capital ships have unique names such as: &ldquo;The Merciless&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Conqueror&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Redoubtable&rdquo;, etc &hellip;</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-skill-points-in-order-to-perform-the-corresponding-action">Do I need skill points in order to perform the corresponding action?</h3>
<p>Usually, yes. All of the Siderian skills and all of the Erased skills (other than infiltration), require a skill point to be able to perform the action. Navarch agents dont need the skill point if the fleet their commanding has the appropriate attributes (bombing or invasion power)</p>

<h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
<h3 id="pillaging-bombingimagesbombingpng">Pillaging <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/bombing.PNG" alt="Bombing"></h3>
<p>Allows a navarch to raid resources from an enemy controlled system or dominion. Compares the navarch&rsquo;s total bombing power against the defense of the system. Increased by Conquest skill, and by having certain types of ships in the fleet. see <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/#what-are-the-base-stats-of-all-of-the-ships">Ship Stats - Bombing</a></p>
<h4 id="does-the-time-to-pillage-depend-on-bombing-power">Does the time to pillage depend on bombing power?</h4>
<p>yes slightly depends on defense and bombing power. The base time length for a pillage is 1h</p>
<h3 id="how-much-will-i-get-from-pillaging">How much will I get from pillaging?</h3>
<p>One pillage gives 150 ticks of the production of the system for a normal level of success, and 200 ticks for a critical. Each pillage lowers % of resources raided by 45% and it recovers over time by .25% per tick</p>
<h3 id="will-my-fleet-take-damage-from-bombing-a-system">Will my fleet take damage from bombing a system?</h3>
<p>Yes the fleet will take damage based on the total amount of defense the system has. On a failure, the damage is increased.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-bombard-and-pillage-actions">What is the difference between Bombard and Pillage actions?</h3>
<p>Both rely upon the bombing power of the fleet, however a bombard will destroy more buildings and kill more people, but without providing resources to the attacker.</p>
<h3 id="conquest-invasionimagesinvasionpng">Conquest <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/invasion.PNG" alt="Invasion"></h3>
<p>Allows a navarch to convert an enemy controlled system or dominion into a system directly under your control. Compares the navarch&rsquo;s total invasion power against the defense of the system. Increased by Conquest skill, and by having certain types of ships in the fleet. see <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/#what-are-the-base-stats-of-all-of-the-ships">Ship Stats - Invasion</a></p>
<h4 id="does-the-time-to-conquest-depend-on-invasion-power">Does the time to conquest depend on invasion power?</h4>
<p>yes slightly depends on defense and invasion power</p>
<h4 id="how-much-invasion-power-do-i-need">How much invasion power do I need?</h4>
<p>Invasion power is compared to system defense</p>
<h3 id="repair-repairimagesrepairpng">Repair <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/repair.PNG" alt="Repair"></h3>
<p>Repairs the fleet under the navarch&rsquo;s control. The Navarch gives 5 points of repair to the fleet for each skill rank. Increased by the Leadership skill, and by having certain types of ships in the fleet. see <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/ships/stats/#what-are-the-base-stats-of-all-of-the-ships">Ship Stats - Repair</a></p>
<h4 id="how-long-do-repairs-take">How long do repairs take?</h4>
<p>Repairs will only happen while a fleet is not moving or engaging in an offensive action. Ships will be repaired starting with the ship at lowest % health first. The rate of repair is:</p>
<p><strong>Repair Score * .5 HP per tick.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: A navarch with 2 ranks of repair, and has a drone carrier x2 in their fleet will have 
(2 ranks * 5) + (4 score from fleet) = 12 repair score. Repairing 6 HP per tick. So in legacy with 3 minute ticks you can estimate it at 120 HP per hour.</p>
<h2 id="stance">Stance</h2>
<h3 id="defender">Defender</h3>
<p>Will join into fights, and engage enemies to prevent pillaging/bombarding/colonization. But will not otherwise start a fight with enemies in the same system</p>
<h3 id="deserter">Deserter</h3>
<p>Attempts to flee combat as soon as possible</p>
<h3 id="prudent">Prudent</h3>
<p>Will only fight if directly attacked</p>
<h3 id="aggressive">Aggressive</h3>
<p>Will automatically engage any enemy in the same system</p>
<h3 id="fury">Fury</h3>
<p>Will automatically engage any enemy in the same system
In a future implementation, will also engage non-allied fleets.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-you-recall-a-navarch-with-a-fleet">What happens if you recall a Navarch with a fleet?</h2>
<p>recalling them will destroy the fleet</p>

<h3 id="propaganda-propagandaimagespropagandapng">Propaganda <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/propaganda.PNG" alt="Propaganda"></h3>
<p>This ability is used to take control over an AI controlled system. It takes the agent&rsquo;s propaganda skill and compares it to the current stability of the system. The attempt takes a long amount of time (~8 hours in legacy). Requires the agent to rest afterwards before they can use any other abilities.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-defend-against-it-other-than-high-stability">How do I defend against it other than high stability?</h4>
<p>If you notice the Siderian in your dominion and suspect a propaganda attempt, you can flip your dominion into a system, canceling the agent&rsquo;s action.</p>
<h3 id="destabilize-destabilizeimagesdestabilizationpng">Destabilize <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/destabilization.PNG" alt="Destabilize"></h3>
<p>This ability reduces the stability of the current system. Useful for setting up a propaganda action later, or reducing the efficiency of the current system. Takes a moderate amount of time (~2.5 hours in legacy). Requires the agent to rest afterwards before they can use any other abilities.</p>
<h3 id="seduce-seduceimagesseductionpng">Seduce <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/seduction.PNG" alt="Seduce"></h3>
<p>This ability can only be used when in the same system as an enemy agent who is visible. Seduction skill gives 13 seduction per rank. This ability compares the siderian agent&rsquo;s seduction skill against the target agent&rsquo;s Determination <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/agent_determination.png" alt="Determination">. If successful, will convert the agent to your side! Instantaneous. Requires the agent to rest afterwards before they can use any other abilities.</p>

<h3 id="infiltration-infiltrationimagesinfiltrationpng">Infiltration <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/infiltration.PNG" alt="Infiltration"></h3>
<p>Infiltration takes somewhere between 2-3 hours and compares the erased agent&rsquo;s infiltration skill against the system&rsquo;s <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/concepts/_index.md#intelligence">intelligence</a> and if successful installs 1 malware, or 2 with a critical success, in the system, increasing visibility on the system, and contributing to the <a href="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/concepts/victory/#path-of-shadows#">Path of Shadow</a> victory</p>

<h3 id="sabotage-sabotageimagessabotagepng">Sabotage <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/sabotage.PNG" alt="Sabotage"></h3>
<p>This ability allows erased agents to damage fleets. It compares the erased agent&rsquo;s sabotage skill VS the protection <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/agent_protection.png" alt="protection"> skill of the navarch controlling the target fleet. Upon success it will damage ships randomly in the fleet. The action is instantaneous.</p>
<h3 id="removal-removalimagesremovalpng">Removal <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/removal.PNG" alt="Removal"></h3>
<p>This ability allows the erased agent to assassinate an enemy governor or agent in the same system. It compares the erased agent&rsquo;s removal skill against the enemy agent&rsquo;s protection <img src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/agent_protection.png" alt="protection"> skill. Upon success it will remove the agent. The action is instantaneous.</p>
<p>Note: When removing a navarch agent with a fleet, it will be replaced with a lv 1 navarch, and the fleet will remain intact</p>

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
foo := "bar";
bar := "foo";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```go
func main() {
  input := `var foo = "bar";`

  lexer := lexers.Get("javascript")
  iterator, _ := lexer.Tokenise(nil, input)
  style := styles.Get("github")
  formatter := html.New(html.WithLineNumbers())

  var buff bytes.Buffer
  formatter.Format(&buff, style, iterator)

  fmt.Println(buff.String())
}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"{`      |

    <div class="lead">What ships are good at what?</div>
	<h3 id="what-ships-counter-what">What ships counter what?</h3>
<p>There is still a lot of room to develop new fleet strategies and counters, but some basics about which ships counter other ships can be derived from looking at their stats, and how the fighting mechanics work out:</p>
<p><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/interceptor.svg"/>
 <strong>Interceptors</strong>:
With their high ship count and moderate overall damage, they are a good counter to Gunners, who can only fire once per attack.
</br></br></p>
<p><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/gunner.svg"/>
 <strong>Gunners</strong>:
With their high explosive damage they do well against high shield targets with low Flack, such as Drone Carriers and Assault Frigates
</br></br></p>
<p><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/ships/drone_carrier.svg"/>
 <strong>Drone Carriers</strong>:
With their high HP and multiple shots, they are good at taking out fighters of all types.
</br></br></p>
<p>Corvettes lay somewhere in the middle, 2x or 4x corvettes will have a hard time against any frigate class, but the more combat focused types (Light Corvettes and multi turret) will do well when they hit the 8x level, at least until the frigates hit their 4x. They can however be an early counter to fighter fleets.</p>
<p>When looking to counter a specific enemy fleet, consider setting up a <a href="https://rising-constellation.com/portal/fight-simulator">simulated fight</a> and playing around with your fleet design in terms of order/layout and composition</p>

hp 2 -&gt; floating gardens <br/>
hp 1 -&gt; upgrade floating gardens to 2<br/>
hp 2 -&gt; upgrade floating gardens to 2<br/>
CHILL/WAIT<br/>
barren planet -&gt; possible impact research center + 4 arrays of excavators before archipelagos ( dont surpass your population )<br/>
hp 2 -&gt; residential archipelago<br/>
hp 1 -&gt; delete 1 residence -&gt; residential archipelago; do it for all residences 1 by 1<br/>
(CHILL/WAIT if you need more population)<br/>

4t ast 3 -&gt; 1 ES<br/>
4t ast 4 -&gt; 1 ES<br/>
3t ast 1 -&gt; 1 ES<br/>
ONLY UPGRADE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. colony ship eats 80k credits, so calc it out with your hypersleep chamber so you can queue it as soon as you get the tech<br/>
4t ast 1 -&gt; upgrade ES<br/>

3t ast 1 -&gt; upgrade ES<br/>
build colony ship ( 32000 production, 80000 credits, 3000 tech ) [ 10 hours ]<br/>
<br/>
TECHS TO START:
<br/>
Holographic Storage System -&gt; Urbanization -&gt; Urbanization II -&gt; maglev architecture -&gt; publicity terminals -&gt; magnetic pipelines -&gt; exobiology -&gt; pressurized enviroment II -&gt; hypersleep chamber -&gt; floating cities
<br/>
<br/>
Another way ( works best if you get tech from someone ):<br/>
Holographic Storage System -&gt; Urbanization -&gt; Urbanization II -&gt; publicity terminals -&gt; floating cities -&gt; magnetic pipelines -&gt; exobiology -&gt; floating cities -&gt; pressurized enviroment II -&gt; hypersleep chamber<br/>
<br/>
LEX TO START: 
<br/>
First Contacts -&gt; Linguistic Unification -&gt; Mass Media -&gt; Promotion of Science -&gt; Sponsored Chairmanship -&gt; Proto-Empire -&gt; Extended Administration -&gt; Stelloliberal maze<br/><br/>
Or the adjusted tech rush build by pray:<br/>
Skip garden and everything, after poly tech to 2, rush experiment station 1 and lvl 2 on asteroid.<br/></p>

<p>In most circumstances, you want to colonize 3 systems as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the beginning, build <em>Delta Polytech</em><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/university.svg"/>
 on your first planet, buy tech for <em>Citadel</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/ideo.svg"/>
 and build the <em>Citadel</em> on the planet as well.</p>
<p>Buy the first technology in habitable, sterile, and asteroid. Build <em>Megapolis</em><img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/main_building.svg"/>
 on the other habitable and <em>Central Hub</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/main_building.svg"/>
on the sterile.</p>
<p>Build both <em>Delta Polytech</em> and <em>Citadel</em> on the second habitable, and build 3 <em>Residential Districts</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/house.svg"/>
 on the first habitable for faster population growth.</p>
<p>Build <em>Impact Research Center</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/microscope.svg"/>
 on the sterile planet, and build one <em>Refining Duct</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/factory.svg"/>
  on each of the 5 industry potential asteroid.</p>
<p>Wait for <em>Exobiology</em> patent, and build <em>Experiment stations</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/microscope.svg"/>
 on every asteroid except the 1 potential one. Buy patent for asteroid level 2, and upgrade asteroid buildings.</p>
<p>Wait for colony ship technology. Buy navarch and colony ship. Look for systems with many habitable slots and good appeal potential because the second system should focus on credit.</p>
<p>Research <em>Publicity Terminal</em> patent and replace the houses on home planet with <em>Archipelagoes</em> <img style="background:black" src="/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/images/svg/buildings/double_house.svg"/>
 . Research habitable level 2. When colonization is complete, develop the second colony and recall the navarch.</p>
<p>Deploy the navarch in home system once the cooldown finishes, and build the next colony ship. You should get enough ideology for the third system when the second colony ship is completed and moves to its destination.</p>
<p>For Lex, rush <em>Mass Media</em> and ignore everything else. Buy Lex slots to make sure all lexes are applied. After <em>Mass Media</em> buy <em>Propaganda</em> to keep population growing. After that save up for <em>Proto Empire</em> and after that <em>Extended Administration</em>.</p>

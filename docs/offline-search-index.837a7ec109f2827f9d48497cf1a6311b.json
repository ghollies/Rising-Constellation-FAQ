[{"body":"Victory How does one team win? There are 3 paths to victory. Each path gives 2/3/5 stars depending on the goals reached. The goal of the game is to hit the 12 stars mark first as a team.\nMobility What does each point do? it increases credits by .1 per system population . When received from a building in a system, it increases the mobility in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.\nOther impacts Mobility is a scaling factor for two late-game buildings: reflect district and business arch. They are generally considered some of the best late game credit generation buildings.\nStability When received from a building in a system, it increases the stability in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.\nFactor’s into growth speed, as you approach 0 stability, or negative values, growth will be hindered.\nWhen below 0, penalties to the system production will occur View the 3rd tab on the system to view specific values:\nWhat exactly does SLSD do? SLSD is like radar? It shows enemy fleet movement in range. Higher SLSD means the radius is larger.\nResources How fast do resources accumulate? The number at the bottom of your screen next to each resource show the amount that will be gained every 3 minutes (In Legacy mode). Common practice is to think of at x20 for the amount per hour you will have.\nResource Tax on player trades How long does it take for tax to drop from 60 to 5 not sure anymore.. but like 2% per hour?\nIs there a resource cap?

The base time length for a pillage is 1h\nHow much will I get from pillaging? One pillage gives 150 ticks of the production of the system for a normal level of success, and 200 ticks for a critical. Each pillage lowers % of resources raided by 45% and it recovers over time by .25% per tick\nConquest Does the time to conquest depend on invasion power? yes slightly depends on defense and invasion power\nHow much invasion power do I need? Invasion power is compared to system defense\nStance What is the difference between “Aggressive” and “Fury” for Navarchs? same currently\nWhat happens if you recall a Navarch with a fleet? recalling them will destroy the fleet\n","categories":"","description":"Agents which can Conquest, Pillage or Attack\n","excerpt":"Agents which can Conquest, Pillage or Attack\n","ref":"/Rising-Constellation-FAQ/docs/agents/navarch/","tags":"","title":"Navarch"},{"body":"Prodction Most of my time so far is spent waiting for science and ideology points. My production is not working, should I be using it for something? it’s completely normal that the first 2 days you are not capping your production and are waiting on techno and ideo, don’t worry.\nWhat is the difference between mobilized and populations? If there are more number of jobs available than population, there is a penalty Each building will say how many mobilized workers it requires. For example requires 2 workers to function optimally, the tooltip on the population icon shows how many your buildings require, vs the total number of people in your system, if the mobilized value is greater than the total you will see penalties in your resource production TODO images\nSystem Population How do populations within a system balance between planets? does it every time you have a new pop it tries to even it between all the planets\nColonizing If I am going to colonize, does it matter how far it is from my home world? where to colonize : in early game, to get your second system, it is advised to get one near you to start building on it faster. But after that, it always depends on the systems available, the faction strategy,etc\nCan I reserve a system? Each faction usually has a chat room dedicated to system reservation to avoid multiple people sending colony ships to the same system and wasting time. Pick a system that looks good to you, and put the NAME XXX:YYY coordinates in the room (these can be found by clicking on the system,\nWhat sectors can I colonize a system in?

The one below is a solid recommendation which could be tweaked, but should provide you with a general idea of where to start.\nOpening In most circumstances, you want to colonize 3 systems as soon as possible.\nIn the beginning, build Delta Polytech on your first planet, buy tech for Citadel and build the Citadel on the planet as well.\nBuy the first technology in habitable, sterile, and asteroid. Build Megapolis on the other habitable and Central Hub on the sterile.\nBuild both Delta Polytech and Citadel on the second habitable, and build 3 Residential Districts on the first habitable for faster population growth.\nBuild Impact Research Center on the sterile planet, and build one Refining Duct on each of the 5 industry potential asteroid.\nWait for Exobiology patent, and build experiment stations on every asteroid except the 1 potential one. Buy patent for asteroid level 2, and upgrade asteroid buildings.\nWait for colony ship technology. Buy navarch and colony ship. Look for systems with many habitable slots and good appeal potential because the second system should focus on credit.\nResearch Publicity Terminal patent and replace the houses on home planet with Archipelagoes. Research habitable level 2. When colonization is complete, develop the second colony and recall the navarch.\nDeploy the navarch in home system once the cooldown finishes, and build the next colony ship. You should get enough ideology for the third system when the second colony ship is completed and moves to its destination.\nFor Lex, rush Mass Media and ignore everything else. Buy Lex slots to make sure all lexes are applied. After Mass Media buy Propaganda to keep population growing.

They automatically construct buildings over time, very inefficiently. They stop building and upgrading when all of their build slots are full.\nHow do I gain control of a Dominion or Autonomous System? People can flip them to their faction by 2 means: use Siderians to destabilize and then propaganda them to flip them into dominions OR Use a navarch with a fleet to conquer it as a system. Both of these will require an open slot (either as dominion, or system slot)\nCan I use a colony ship to take control of an autonomous system? No, only conquest or propaganda\nWhat sectors can I take over an AI controlled system in? You can only take control of systems in sectors adjacent to one your faction already owns, or in a sector your faction owns.\nAutonomous systems Are they farmable? yes, Pillaging them is a good way to both level up your agents, and gain resources, repairing buildings is not too hard if someone takes it over. see Pillaging\nDominions If I queue a bunch of upgrades in a system and then flip it to domain, does it continue on its happy path? yes\nIf I develop a system then switch it over to a domain system, does the AI then re-build everything or would it stay optimized to what I have created? IA can’t destroy then rebuild, so it will stay optimized. However, it won’t upgrade them all the way (stops when all the slots are taken by a building)\nSwapping a system from dominion to system has an increasing ideology cost of +5k each time you flip any system.
